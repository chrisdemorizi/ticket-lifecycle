<h2>Takeaways and Key Skills Developed</h2>

In this project, I demonstrated the ticket lifecycle in osTicket by creating and resolving tickets as both an end-user and a help desk agent. I configured ticket properties such as priority, department, and SLA and worked through each stage of the lifecycle: intake, assignment, communication, and resolution. This hands-on experience helped me understand the full process of ticket management, including configuring workflows and roles, as well as observing how tickets are managed and resolved from start to finish within a ticketing system.
